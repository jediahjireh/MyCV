        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            <b>Lifelong Learner:</b>
            <br>
            From an early age, I have immersed myself into exploring the world of technology and the endless
            possibilities
            that it has to offer. It all started with a fondness for problem-solving and expanded into a deep-rooted
            passion,
            ignited by the potential of technology to effect meaningful change in society.
            <br><br>
            The realm of technology is ever-evolving and I'm committed to staying at the forefront of advancements. Such
            as
            the journey
            of life, the journey of someone in the tech industry is anchored in continuous learning and development,
            which I
            embrace.
            It is an integral part of my growth as a developer and I welcome challenges that push me to constantly
            refine my
            craft.
            <br><br>
            <b>Debugging the World:</b>
            <br>
            The intersection of technology and social impact can drive meaningful change. Beyond building cutting-edge
            applications,
            my true passion lies in using my skills to combat social injustice. My primary goal is to leverage my skills
            in
            order to make
            a tangible difference in the world. My dream is to contribute my abilities to the fight against the heinous
            crime of human trafficking,
            using technology to empower anti-trafficking organisations and to aid them in the mission to rescue and
            support
            survivors.
            <br><br>
            <b>Vision for the Future:</b>
            <br>
            Looking ahead, my vision is to establish myself as a proficient software engineer/web developer in the
            industry.
            Whether it's creating innovative web solutions, optimising user experiences or developing scalable
            applications
            and platforms, I'm driven to bring about meaningful change. Technology, when wielded responsibly, can be a
            catalyst for social
            progress. It can serve as a powerful tool to empower the vulnerable, raise awareness and drive sustainable
            solutions.
